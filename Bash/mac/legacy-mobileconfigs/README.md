# Legacy Mobileconfigs

These are kept around for legacy usage

## Do not use these these files unless you are specifically directed to by Huntress Support

- `Huntress PPPC.mobileconfig`: This payload will grant the Huntress agent FDA (full disk access). This file does not configure the System Extension and should be used for deployments that only use the Huntress Agent. No partners should use this unless expressly directed to by Huntress Support.

- `HuntressLegacyAgentProfile.mobileconfig`: A legacy profile used for versions of the Huntress macOS Agent before version `0.13.72`. Kept around for historical reasons, no partners should use this unless expressly directed to by Huntress Support.
